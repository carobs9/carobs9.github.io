Hi! I am a [Social Data Science MSc.](https://www.ku.dk/studies/masters/social-data-science) graduate from the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en), with a focus on the field of data science and analytics, particularly interested in the use of machine learning, natural language processing and network analysis tools to find relevant solutions to problems.

#### About this website

More than a personal website, this is a place where I post some of the last projects I have been working on, learning or curious about, and some of my personal information. Essentially, this is more like a blog or a place where I take notes about topics that I find interesting.

#### Interests 

- Urban mobility
- Natural language processing
- Geospatial data science
